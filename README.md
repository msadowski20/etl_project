<h1><center><b>ETL Project - Brian Remite, Jeremy Brent, Kevin Kleyman, Matt Sadowski<center></b></h1>

<h2> For this project, we have created a "Critterpedia" of all of the bugs, fish, and villagers within Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</h2> 
<h4>Using our tool, you will be able to...</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Collect all of the data for each critter type, including when they are available throughout the year.</li>
    <li>Keep track of which critters you have collected for your museum.</li>
    <li>Which residents you have on your island.</li>
</ul>

<h1> Before You Begin </h1>
<h4> Follow these steps </h4>

<ol>
<li>Create a new database in PostgresSQL titled "ACNH_Critterpedia", and then open up the query tool in the new database.</li>

<li> Clone the repository to your local computer </li>

<li>Copy the code from schema.sql in the root of the repository into the query tool within PostgresSQL to create the database table structure.</li>

<li>Open and update the <i>/Resources/config.py</i> file with your username and password for PostgresSQL.</li>

<li>Run the Jupyter Notebooks within the Notebooks folder in the numerical order specified to populate the database.
    <ol>
        <li>bugs.ipynb</li>
        <li>fish.ipynb</li>
        <li>villagers.ipynb</li>
        <li>collections.ipynb</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Our Extraction, Transformation and Load Process</h2>
<ul>
    <li>We scraped the Animal Crossing Wiki web pages for the Fish and Bugs data to pull out the tables.  The tables contain data for Fish and Bug Name, Price, Location, as well as the Time and Months that each is available to catch.  We put both of those tables into a DataFrame and assigned unique IDs for each item.</li>
    <li>We pulled a csv file from Kaggle that contained the data for all of the Villagers such as Name, ID, Gender, Species.</li>
    <li>We combined all of the data for Fish, Bugs and Villagers into a "Critterpedia" which can be used to track all of the players progress in collecting all possible critters.</li>
    <li>Lastly, we created a user table which contains E-Mail addresses for players and their total collections.  This data was all created at random and does not contain any real user data.  This table would be used to track any players real progress in the game.
    
</ul>
<ol>
    <h4> ETL Process in 1-bugs.ipynb (displayed below) and 2-fish.ipynb(not displayed) </h4>
    <p> Note, screenshots of the notebook for the 1-bugs.ipynb are included. The transformation process for 1-bugs.ipynb and 2-fish.ipynb was the same. </p>
    <li> We read the table from the wiki links provided <a href="#Sources"> in sources. </a>
    <img src = "Images/bugs_screenshot1.png" alt="Reading wiki Table">
    <li> We then changed values to clean the data. </li>
    <img src = "Images/bugs_screenshot2.png" alt="Changing cell values">
    <li> The final transformation included splitting the tables for the database. </li>

    <li> The loading is visualized in the screenshot below. </li>
    <img src = "Images/bugs_screenshot6.png" alt="Loading the data">
</ol>
<ol>
    <h4> ETL Process for 4-collections.ipynb </h4>
    <li>We imported a list of random E-mail addresses and put them into a dataframe.</li>
    <img src = "Images/email_screenshot.png" alt="Import E-Mail Addresses">
    <li>We randomly added critter IDs and Types for all of the E-mail address.</li>
    <img src = "Images/id_type_screenshot.png" alt="Add IDs and Types">
    <li>Finally, we looped through all of the rows and added Boolean values for Caught and Donated for each user.  Also, we added a True value for Resident if the critter type was Villager.</li>
